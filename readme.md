# ChatRoom

A simple client-server chat application made with NodeJs.
This version use http connection rather than socket, which is not suited for this use case.
In a future iteration, I will implement it with socket, but for now I need to learn the basic of NodeJs, therefore let's tone  down the difficulty.

## Installation

As a pre-requisite, you must have **NodeJs** installed on your computer (Type `node -v` to check), otherwise install it first.
Open the project root directory in your terminal and type : 

```
npm install
```

## Usage

After installation, type the following commands in the project root directory in your terminal : 

```
npm start
```

By default, the app is running at `localhost:2200/`, therefore open your browser with that URL.
